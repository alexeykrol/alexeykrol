## Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I build AI agents, meta-frameworks, and autonomous workflows that actually get work done — not demos, not hype. Exploring AI as a **tool of freedom**, not a replacement for thinking. Writer, system designer, and product thinker.

---

### What I focus on

- Designing **autonomous AI agents** with long execution horizons  
- Building **AI-assisted development frameworks** (agents + specs + memory)  
- Secure infrastructure: auth, RLS, tokens, verification, edge logic  
- Teaching non-technical people how to *use* AI, not fear it  
- Writing about AI, cognition, power, and agency

## 🧠 Current interests

- Long-running agents vs interactive chat paradigms  
- Specs, contracts, and tests as the core interface to AI  
- “Software as memory, agents as execution” models  
- Cognitive and political distortions in AI-generated knowledge  
- AI as a socio-technical power amplifier

---

## ✍️ Writing & thinking

I write essays, guides, and experimental texts about:
- AI and autonomy  
- Cognitive traps around “intelligent systems”  
- Why most people underestimate current AI — and overestimate future magic  
- How to design systems that stay human-controlled

---

## 📍 Meta

- Based in the US (California)  
- Working independently  
- Not looking for “AI hype” collaborations  
- Interested in serious systems, research-minded builders, and long-form projects
